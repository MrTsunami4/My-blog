## About me

I am a French student in computer science in the south of France.

I enjoy programming about :

- low level programming, but with nice abstraction. I enjoy controlling the hardware that I use, not having to debug by one errors all day long.

- web backend, because you need to think about ergonomics and scalability

- and game, because everybody like videogames

## This blog

This blog Â is my place to talk about everything that i like about programming, and to put what I'm thinking about in a place where I can share it and save it for later.

This blog is made with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a blazingly fast ðŸš€static site engine written in Rust, and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), witch is free, fast, and cached in the entire world. I also just need to push it on Github to have it updated everywhere.
